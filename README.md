Clara 2
=======

Clara2 - a parallel classical radiation calculator based on Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials


Introduction
------------

Clara stands for CLAssical RAdiation and is a redevelopment from scratch of [Clara1](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/clara1).
It has been developed as part of a [diploma thesis](http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=38997) in 2012.
In contrast to [Clara1](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/clara1) it is parallelized using MPI and OpenMP to run efficiently on large CPU clusters.
